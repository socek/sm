1. What is this?
================
This is a simple project for exercise. Very simple 2 mini apps on pyramid.

2. What do you need?
====================
To run this project you need python3 (i think it will not work on 2.7, but it
was not tested) and virtualenv. Other dependecies will go to a virtual
envoritment. And a GNU Make if you want the automatic builder.

2. How to develop
=================
If you want to quickly run development server just run:
    > make
Makefile will do the rest for you. All dependecies are in setup.py.
